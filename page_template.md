## Projects

### Project 1: Analysis of the Nebraska USEPA SDWIS Database
The goal of this project is to provide a precise and detailed data analysis of Nebraska drinking water that is currently available to the public. A request for proposal (RFP) was made by our client, Zenith Data Analysis. Our client has requested that we touch on three main points in our analyses: An overall evaluation of the number of violations experienced by each water system type including community, non-transient non-community, and transient non-community water systems. This evaluation has been asked to include the mean, minimum, maximum, and medium number of violations by each water system type. Zenith has also requested that a summary of the types of contaminants found in drinking water, preferably organized such that it mirrors the prior tasks formatting. This summary should also consist of population. For our final task, our client has asked that we look at small community water systems and only consider the following data: the type of source water used by the community water system, active systems, systems that have received Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) violations, and that we report the data by contaminant name in a clearly labeled and organized data table.

### Project 2: Statics Calcuations
In project 2 we are being asked to create a tool in python That will be used for calculating and analyzing static structures. This tool will be used for unit conversions and analyze each of its conversions. The tool will also be able to calculate the units in different types of loads either at single points, lines, or over an area. Another way it will be tested is inputting different values like magnitude of load, location, and the angle of the application. We are given 3 weeks to create a pilot for this tool so our PE can analyze its usefulness.

### Project 3: Analysis of Nebraska Natonal Household Travel Survey (NHTS) Datasets
Transportation systems play a vital role in economic development and daily life. To support informed decision making, the US collects extensive data through surveys and simulations. Our project aims to analyze two key datasets: the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM). 
Our goal is to process, organize, and visualize these datasets to assist the transportation planning group in understanding travel patterns and driving behavior.

### Project 4: NRI Risk Index Analysis
Risk Averse, LLC (imaginary client)  has engaged our consulting team to conduct a sensitivity analysis on the National Risk Index (NRI) scoring methodology developed by FEMA. This project aims to identify potential biases in the NRI by comparing its risk scoring methods to an independently developed risk scoring methodology. Using the NRI dataset, we will evaluate the risk levels in two U.S. states and assess how different risk definitions influence the classification of communities and their eligibility for disaster mitigation funding.

### Project 5: Midwestern Travel Behavior Analysis Using the NHTS Datasets
Objectives
The goal of this project is to explore patterns in travel behavior across the Midwest region using the 2022 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). The findings will support evidence-based planning and transportation policy for a coalition of Midwestern Departments of Transportation.
Regional Focus
This analysis will focus exclusively on respondents located in Midwestern states as defined by the NHTS regional coding. The aim is to uncover regional trends and travel behavior patterns that are specific to Midwestern households and communities.
Methodological Approach
The study will address two original research questions, each requiring the integration of variables across multiple NHTS datasets (e.g., household, person, trip, and vehicle levels). The project will involve data cleaning, merging, and filtering to prepare the data for cross-level analysis.
